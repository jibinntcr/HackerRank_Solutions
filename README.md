## About

This repository is a collection of my solutions to HackerRank problems. Each problem has its own folder, containing the solution file and any necessary additional files. I've used multiple programming languages to solve these problems, providing diversity in my approach to problem-solving.

## Languages

I've solved problems using the following programming languages:

- Python
- Java
- C++

Feel free to browse through the folders to find solutions in your preferred language.

## How to Use

To access a specific problem solution, navigate to the corresponding folder and open the solution file. The file is usually named `solution.<extension>` where `<extension>` is the file type used for the specific programming language.

Feel free to use these solutions as a reference for your own learning. However, I encourage you to solve the problems on your own first before checking the solutions.

## Contributing

If you have a different or more optimized solution to any of the problems, I'd love to see it! Feel free to open a pull request with your changes. Please follow the existing folder structure and naming conventions.

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue.

## License

Feel free to use the code as you see fit, and happy coding!
